Phylogenetic diversity responses to land use change

This repository contains all code used to analyze the data and create the
figures for a manuscript exploring the effects of land use change on 
phylogenetic diversity.

If you wish to use the large mammal data in this repository in a publication, please contact Tim O'Brien, author on the manuscript where these analyses are published. If you wish to use the plant or small mammal data, please contact Hillary Young, also an author on the manuscript where these analyses are published.
